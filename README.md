## Project Description
Project: Android Plant Detection Using GEMINI-AI
This project is a mobile application that leverages Google's Gemini AI model for image-based search, focusing on plant detection. The app allows users to upload an image, and if it's a plant, the app provides details about the plant. If the image is not of a plant, the app responds with a message saying "No Plant Detected."

NOTE :- API KEY IS PROVIDED INSIDE "ChatData.kt" file
